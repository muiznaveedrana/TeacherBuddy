# Persistent Context Notes

This file is auto-injected by the SessionStart hook on every session start, resume, and compaction.
Use it to store notes that should persist across context compressions.

## Current Focus
<!-- Update this with your current work focus -->

## Important Reminders

## Night Worker Notes
<!-- The Night Worker system will update this section with progress -->
