# Worksheet Quality Assessment Criteria

This skill documents the strict quality criteria for worksheet assessment.

## Zero-Tolerance Policy

ANY of these = AUTOMATIC FAIL:
- Broken images (placeholder/empty boxes)
- Identical objects in comparison questions
- Missing questions (cut-off content)
- Empty answer keys

## Critical Checks

### 1. Image Integrity
- ALL images must load correctly
- No placeholder or empty image boxes
- Images must be appropriately sized
- High contrast for visibility

### 2. Comparison Questions (Reception Focus)
- Objects MUST have OBVIOUS visual differences
- Size difference: 30-50% minimum
- For 4-5 year olds: Differences must be immediately apparent
- Ask: "Can a child answer this by LOOKING?"

### 3. Content Completeness
- ALL expected questions visible
- No cut-off or truncated content
- Answer keys match question counts

### 4. Age Appropriateness
- Reception (4-5 years): 2 steps max with guidance
- Q5 complexity check for each year group

## Scoring System

### Auto-Fail Score Caps
| Issue | Maximum Score |
|-------|---------------|
| Any broken images | 65 |
| Unanswerable comparisons | 40 |
| Missing questions | (% visible × 100) |

### Production Ready Threshold
- Score >= 95
- AND zero critical issues

## Assessment Categories

### AUTO-FAIL
- Broken images
- Empty answer keys
- Mismatched question counts

### CRITICAL
- Cross-out marks (any X marks)
- Answer clues visible
- Split visual representations

### DIFFICULTY
- Q5 complexity check
- Age-appropriate challenge level

### VISUAL
- Image size adequacy
- Layout clarity
- Contrast levels

## Child Simulation Test

For each question, simulate a child of the target age:
- Reception: 4-5 years old
- Year 1: 5-6 years old
- Year 2: 6-7 years old

Ask: "Can this child complete this question independently?"

## Quality Mantra

> "When in doubt, FAIL it. Quality > Quantity."
