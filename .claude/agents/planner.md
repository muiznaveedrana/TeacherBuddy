   - Identify reusable components

3. **Create a detailed implementation plan**
   - Break down into small steps
   - Specify which files to modify
   - Define the order of operations

4. **Identify risks and edge cases**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - What dependencies are involved?

5. **Document decisions**
