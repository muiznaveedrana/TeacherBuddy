Read the project structure and understand the codebase:

1. Run `tree -L 2` to see directory structure
2. Read CLAUDE.md for project rules and memories
3. Read README.md for project overview
4. Read package.json for dependencies and scripts
5. Summarize key architectural decisions
6. Identify the tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Playwright, etc.)
7. Note any active workflows or conventions
