# Implementation Planning

Before implementing: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Steps

1. **Analyze the requirement** - Understand what's being asked
2. **Research existing patterns** - Look at how similar things are done in the codebase
3. **Identify affected files** - List all files that will be modified or created
4. **Create step-by-step plan** - Break down into small, testable steps
5. **Identify risks** - What could go wrong? Edge cases?
6. **Estimate complexity** - Simple/Medium/Complex
7. **Wait for approval** - Do NOT start coding until plan is approved
