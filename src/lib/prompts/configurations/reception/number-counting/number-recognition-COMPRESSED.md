# Reception: Number Recognition - COMPRESSED

**Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. Range: 1-10. Format: 5 distinct types.**

## Image Rules
`<img src="/images/WORKSHEET_OBJECTS/counting/{category}/{object}.png" width="50" height="50" alt="{Object}" />`

## Question Logical Validity
**CRITICAL**: Questions MUST be logically answerable. Don't ask for characteristics objects don't have (e.g., "erasers that look like circles" - erasers are rectangular).

## 5-Question Structure (REQUIRED ORDER)
1. **Number** - Display small number, write answer
2. **Multiple Choice** - Number with 3 groups (A/B/C)
   - Groups A/B/C MUST have DIFFERENT counts (differ by 1-2 objects)
   - Layout: HORIZONTAL (side-by-side) or compact 2+1 grid
3. **Ten Frame** - Count objects in frame
   - Use ONLY compact objects: apple, orange, strawberry, grape, cookie, cupcake, circle, square, heart, star, diamond, sun, moon, ball, football, basketball, tennis_ball, block, eraser
   - PROHIBITED: pencil, ruler, carrot, cucumber, bat, scissors, flower, leaf, worm
4. **Context** - Story with child name + objects
5. **Matching** - Connect 2 numbers to 4 picture groups

## Objects (67)
**fruits**: apple, banana, orange, strawberry, grape, pear, lemon, watermelon, peach, pineapple
**farm_animals**: chicken, cow, sheep, pig, horse, duck, goat, goose, turkey
**garden**: flower, butterfly, bee, bird, tree, leaf, mushroom, worm, acorn
**school_supplies**: book, pencil, eraser, crayon, marker, scissors, ruler, glue, backpack
**toys**: ball, doll, kite, block
**vegetables**: carrot, tomato, broccoli, cucumber, pepper, potato
**sports**: football, basketball, tennis_ball, bat, medal
**food_treats**: cookie, cupcake
**shapes**: star, heart, circle, square, diamond, sun, moon
**vehicles**: car, bus, bike, train, plane

## Child Names
Emma, Ben, Sam, Lily, Oliver, Sophie, Jack, Mia

## Styling Rules - MANDATORY
**Background colors:** EVERY question MUST have colored background (NEVER plain white)
**Color rotation:** Q1=#FFF9C4, Q2=#F1F8E9, Q3=#E3F2FD, Q4=#FCE4EC, Q5=#FFF3E0
**Question text:** BLACK (NO color styling)
**Q1 display number:** 48px font size, can have color

## Templates
**Q1: Display Number** - Show number at 48px (NOT 120px - too much space), student writes it
**Q2: Multiple Choice** - "Which group has X?" with 3 groups (A/B/C) showing DIFFERENT counts
**Q3: Ten Frame** - Count objects in ten-frame grid
**Q4: Context Story** - "Emma saw **some** pigs. How many pigs?" + SHOW images (NO drawing tasks!)
**Q5: Matching** - Connect 2 numbers to 4 picture groups

**CRITICAL Q4 RULES**:
- ❌ NEVER state number in question ("Emma saw 6 pigs")
- ✅ Use "some" ("Emma saw some pigs")
- ❌ NEVER ask "Draw the X"
- ✅ Provide images for student to COUNT

**CRITICAL Q5 RULES**:
- ❌ NEVER repeat same picture group (e.g., "3 bananas" twice)
- ✅ All 4 groups have DIFFERENT counts
- ✅ Example: Numbers 3,9 → Groups: 2,3,7,9 (NOT 3,9,3,9)

**Backgrounds (rotate)**: #FFF9C4, #F1F8E9, #E3F2FD, #FCE4EC, #FFF3E0
