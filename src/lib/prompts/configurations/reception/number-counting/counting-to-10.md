## üö´ FORBIDDEN QUESTION FORMAT (VIOLATION = UNUSABLE WORKSHEET)

**YOU MUST NEVER STATE THE NUMBER IN THE QUESTION TEXT.**

The student must count the images to find the answer. If you include the number in the question, the student can answer without counting, making the worksheet completely useless.

**FORBIDDEN FORMATS - DO NOT USE THESE:**
- ‚ùå "[Name] has 8 [objects]. How many [objects] does [Name] have?"
- ‚ùå "[Name] is counting 5 [objects]. How many are there?"
- ‚ùå "There are 3 [objects]. How many [objects] are there?"
- ‚ùå ANY format that mentions a specific number before asking the question

**ONLY USE THESE APPROVED FORMATS:**
- ‚úÖ "How many [objects] are there?"
- ‚úÖ "How many [objects] does [Name] have?"
- ‚úÖ "Count the [objects]."
- ‚úÖ "[Name] is counting [objects]. How many are there?"

## Core Requirements

### 1. Image Display Rules
**MANDATORY:** Use `<img>` tags for ALL countable objects
- Pattern: `/images/WORKSHEET_OBJECTS/counting/{category}/{object}.png`
- Format: `<img src="{path}" width="50" height="50" alt="{Object}" />`
- NEVER use text labels or emoji for countable items

### 2. Question Structure
Each question must have:
- Colored background (rotate: #FFF9C4, #F1F8E9, #E3F2FD, #FCE4EC, #FFF3E0)
- Question text with number
- `.counting-objects-grid` container with images
- Answer line

### 3. Approved Question Templates
Use these formats ONLY (vary usage across questions):
1. "How many [objects] are there?"
2. "How many [objects] does [Name] have?"
3. "Count the [objects]."
4. "[Name] is counting [objects]. How many are there?"
