# Reception Counting (1-10) - COMPRESSED

**Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. Range: 1-10.**

## üö´ CRITICAL: Never state number in question
‚ùå "[Name] has 8 apples" | ‚úÖ "How many apples are there?"
Student MUST count images to find answer.

## Image Rules
`<img src="/images/WORKSHEET_OBJECTS/counting/{category}/{object}.png" width="50" height="50" alt="{Object}" />`
NO text/emoji for countable items.

## Question Templates (vary)
1. "How many [objects] are there?"
2. "How many [objects] does [Name] have?"
3. "Count the [objects]."
4. "[Name] is counting [objects]. How many are there?"

## Objects (67) - DIFFERENT object per question
