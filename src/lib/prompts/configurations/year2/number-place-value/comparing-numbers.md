# Year 2: Comparing Numbers - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 comparing numbers worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Comparison Concepts (CRITICAL)
- **Compare numbers 0-100** using <, >, = symbols
- Use place value to compare (tens first, then ones)
- Order numbers from smallest to largest
- Use vocabulary: greater than, less than, equal to

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Progress from visual comparison to abstract symbols

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Base-10 blocks** for visual comparison
- **Place value charts** showing tens and ones
- **Comparison symbols** (<, >, =)
- Number lines for ordering

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Comparison vocabulary**: greater than (>), less than (<), equal to (=)
- "Which number is bigger/smaller?"
- Real-world contexts familiar to ages 6-7

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Visual Comparison (Base-10 Blocks)** - Compare two numbers using blocks
**Q2: Symbol Practice** - Use <, >, = to compare two numbers
**Q3: Order Numbers** - Arrange 4 numbers from smallest to largest
**Q4: Place Value Reasoning** - Compare using tens and ones understanding
**Q5: Word Problem** - Real-world comparison context

## COMPARISON SYMBOLS

- **Greater than (>)**: Points to smaller number (e.g., 47 > 32)
- **Less than (<)**: Points to smaller number (e.g., 25 < 61)
- **Equal to (=)**: Both sides same value (e.g., 50 = 50)

## TEACHING TIP: Place Value Strategy

Compare tens first: If tens are different, that determines which is greater
If tens are same, compare ones: The larger ones digit makes the number greater
