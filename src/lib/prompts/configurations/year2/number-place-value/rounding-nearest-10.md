# Year 2: Rounding to Nearest 10 - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 rounding to nearest 10 worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Rounding Concepts (CRITICAL)
- **Round numbers 0-100 to nearest 10**
- Use number lines to visualize rounding
- **Key rule**: Look at ones digit (1-4 rounds down, 5-9 rounds up)
- Multiples of 10 stay the same (20→20, 50→50)

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Progress from number line visualization to abstract rounding

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Number lines showing decades** (20, 30, 40, etc.)
- **Midpoint markers** showing where numbers round up vs down
- Color coding: blue for round down, red for round up
- Clear visual of nearest 10

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Simple rounding vocabulary**: nearest 10, closer to, rounds to
- "Which 10 is it closer to?"
- Real-world contexts (rounding money, ages, etc.)

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Number Line Visual** - Circle nearest 10 on number line
**Q2: Round Single Numbers** - Round 3 numbers to nearest 10
**Q3: Ones Digit Rule** - Identify which numbers round to given 10
**Q4: Rounding in Context** - Real-world estimation problem
**Q5: Challenge Problem** - Round and compare multiple numbers

## ROUNDING RULE (Simple for Ages 6-7)

**Look at the ONES digit:**
- 0: Already at a ten (stays same)
- 1, 2, 3, 4: Round DOWN to lower ten
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9: Round UP to higher ten

**Examples:**
- 23 → 20 (ones digit is 3, round down)
- 47 → 50 (ones digit is 7, round up)
- 85 → 90 (ones digit is 5, round up)
- 30 → 30 (already a ten)
