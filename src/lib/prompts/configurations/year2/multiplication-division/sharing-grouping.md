# Year 2: Sharing and Grouping - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 sharing and grouping worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Division Concepts (CRITICAL)
- **Two types**: Sharing (partitive) and Grouping (quotitive)
- **Sharing**: Divide 12 cookies between 3 children (12 ÷ 3 = 4 each)
- **Grouping**: Put 12 cookies into groups of 3 (12 ÷ 3 = 4 groups)
- Link to multiplication (inverse relationship)
- Use 2, 5, 10 times tables for division

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Include both sharing and grouping types

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Circles/plates for sharing equally**
- **Groups/boxes for grouping**
- **WORKSHEET_OBJECTS** for concrete representation
- Visual arrows showing distribution

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Division vocabulary**: share, divide, split, groups of, each
- "Share 12 equally between 3"
- "Make groups of 4"

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Sharing Visual** - Share objects equally (e.g., 15 apples between 3 plates)
**Q2: Grouping Visual** - Make groups of given size (e.g., put 20 into groups of 5)
**Q3: Link to Multiplication** - If 3 × 4 = 12, then 12 ÷ 3 = ?
**Q4: Mixed Division** - Both sharing and grouping (4 problems)
**Q5: Word Problem** - Real-world division context

## SHARING VS GROUPING

**Sharing (Partitive Division):**
- "Share 20 stickers equally between 5 children"
- Know: Total (20), number of groups (5)
- Find: How many in each group? (20 ÷ 5 = 4 each)

**Grouping (Quotitive Division):**
- "Put 20 stickers into groups of 4"
- Know: Total (20), size of each group (4)
- Find: How many groups? (20 ÷ 4 = 5 groups)
