# Year 2: Equal Groups - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 equal groups worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Equal Groups Concept (CRITICAL)
- **Understand multiplication as equal groups**
- "5 groups of 3" vs "3 groups of 5" (commutative property)
- Visual representation using WORKSHEET_OBJECTS
- Count groups, then count items in each group

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Progress from visual counting to abstract multiplication

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Circles/boxes grouping objects**
- **WORKSHEET_OBJECTS** for concrete representation
- Clear separation between groups
- Group labels and totals

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Group vocabulary**: groups of, in each group, altogether
- "How many groups?", "How many in each group?"
- Real-world contexts (plates of cookies, bags of marbles)

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Count Equal Groups** - Visual with circles showing groups
**Q2: Draw Equal Groups** - Create groups from description
**Q3: Write Multiplication** - From visual to number sentence
**Q4: Comparison** - More groups vs more in each group
**Q5: Word Problem** - Equal groups in context

## EQUAL GROUPS EXAMPLES

**3 groups of 4:**
```
[🍎🍎🍎🍎] [🍎🍎🍎🍎] [🍎🍎🍎🍎]
3 groups × 4 in each = 12 total
```

**5 groups of 2:**
```
[🍎🍎] [🍎🍎] [🍎🍎] [🍎🍎] [🍎🍎]
5 groups × 2 in each = 10 total
```
