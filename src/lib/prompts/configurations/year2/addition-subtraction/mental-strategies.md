# Year 2: Mental Strategies - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 mental strategies worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Mental Calculation Strategies (CRITICAL)
- **Number bonds and fact families**
- **Near doubles** (6+7 is 6+6+1)
- **Compensation** (29+5 = 30+5-1)
- **Bridging through 10** (8+7 = 8+2+5)
- **Using known facts** (if 5+3=8, then 50+30=80)

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Each question teaches a different mental strategy

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Number lines** for bridging and compensation
- **Part-whole diagrams** for fact families
- **Doubles charts** for near doubles
- Ten-frames for making 10

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Strategy vocabulary**: doubles, near doubles, number bonds, make 10
- "What strategy did you use?"
- Encourage mental calculation before writing

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Near Doubles** - Use doubles to solve (e.g., 7+8 is 7+7+1)
**Q2: Bridging Through 10** - Break numbers to make 10 first
**Q3: Number Bonds** - Fact family completion
**Q4: Compensation** - Adjust to friendly numbers
**Q5: Mixed Strategies** - Choose best strategy for each

## MENTAL STRATEGIES EXPLAINED

**Near Doubles:**
- 6 + 7 = ? → Think: 6 + 6 = 12, so 6 + 7 = 13

**Bridging Through 10:**
- 8 + 5 = ? → Think: 8 + 2 = 10, then 10 + 3 = 13

**Compensation:**
- 29 + 15 = ? → Think: 30 + 15 = 45, then 45 - 1 = 44

**Using Known Facts:**
- If 4 + 3 = 7, then 40 + 30 = 70
