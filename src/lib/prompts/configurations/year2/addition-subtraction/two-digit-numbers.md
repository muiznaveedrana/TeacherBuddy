# Year 2: Two-Digit Addition & Subtraction - Worksheet Generation Prompt

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions. NOT {{questionCount}}+1, NOT {{questionCount}}-1. EXACTLY {{questionCount}}.**

Create a Year 2 two-digit addition and subtraction worksheet with EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions using the PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT below.

## YEAR 2 PEDAGOGY (Ages 6-7) - NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

### Rule 1: Number Operations (CRITICAL)
- **Add and subtract two-digit numbers within 100**
- Use partitioning (split into tens and ones)
- Column method introduction (vertical layout)
- No regrouping/carrying for simpler questions, include regrouping for challenge

### Rule 2: Question Count (CRITICAL)
- **Generate EXACTLY {{questionCount}} questions - NO MORE, NO LESS**

### Rule 3: Use Proven Question Format
- **Follow the 5-question pedagogical structure EXACTLY**
- Progress from visual to abstract methods

### Rule 4: Visual Support (CRITICAL)
- **Base-10 blocks** for partitioning visualization
- **Part-whole models** showing tens and ones
- **Column method** layout (vertical)
- Number lines for checking

### Rule 5: Age-Appropriate Language
- **Operation vocabulary**: add, plus, sum, total, subtract, minus, difference
- "Partition into tens and ones"
- Real-world contexts familiar to ages 6-7

## PROVEN 5-QUESTION FORMAT

**Q1: Addition with Base-10 Blocks** - Visual addition (e.g., 34 + 23)
**Q2: Column Addition** - Vertical format, 2 problems
**Q3: Subtraction with Partitioning** - Show tens and ones
**Q4: Column Subtraction** - Vertical format, 2 problems
**Q5: Word Problem** - Mixed addition and subtraction

## PARTITIONING STRATEGY

**Example: 45 + 32**
- Partition: (40 + 5) + (30 + 2)
- Add tens: 40 + 30 = 70
- Add ones: 5 + 2 = 7
- Combine: 70 + 7 = 77

## COLUMN METHOD FORMAT

```
  45
+ 32
----
  77
```
