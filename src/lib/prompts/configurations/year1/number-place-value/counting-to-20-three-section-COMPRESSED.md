# Ages 5-6: Counting to 20

**Worksheet Structure:**
*   **Header:** "My Daily MATHS", "Week 3 Day 2", "Counting to 20".
*   **Main Content (Two Columns):**
    *   **Column 1: Arithmetic**
        *   Title: "Arithmetic"
        *   Instruction: "Write the missing numbers on the number lines below."
        *   Four number line questions (1-4): Each shows a number line from 10 to 20 with 1-2 missing numbers to be filled in (e.g., 10, 11, ___, 13...).
    *   **Column 2: Word Problem**
        *   Title: "Word Problem"
        *   Question 5: "12 children are playing in the park. Use ticks on two tens frames to show the number of children playing in the park." (Visual: Two bunny heads above two 10-frame grids).
        *   Question 6: "15 balloons are at a party. If 4 balloons popped, how many balloons are left?" (Visual: 15 balloon shapes, 4 crossed out).
*   **Reasoning Section:**
    *   Title: "Reasoning"
    *   Question 7: "Circle the odd one out. How do you know?"
    *   Visual items:
        *   A block of 10 small squares.
        *   Outline of two hands (representing 10 fingers).
        *   A domino with 6 dots (3 on top, 3 on bottom).
    *   Expected answer: The domino is the odd one out because it represents 6, while the others represent 10.
*   **Footer:**
    *   "I scored ___ out of 7" (input box).
    *   "© www.mydailymaths.com".
*   **Bottom Illustration:** A row of colorful cartoon birds on a wavy line.

**Styling Notes:**
*   Use distinct background colors for header elements (logo, week/day, counting).
*   Use light blue background for section titles.
*   Number lines should have clear ticks and labels/input fields below the line, with arrows at both ends.
*   Tens frames: Purple border, cells for ticks.
*   Balloons: Oval shapes in various colors, crossed-out for "popped".
*   Reasoning items: Gold block for 10 squares, hand emojis for hands, black and white domino with dots. Odd one out should be visibly circled (e.g., red border).
*   Footer should be at the bottom, with score box and copyright.
*   Bird illustration: Colorful, playful, at the very bottom.
*   Overall: Clean, child-friendly, worksheet-like appearance.
