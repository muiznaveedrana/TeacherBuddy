# Year 3 Column Subtraction (With Exchange) - Mixed Layout

## Worksheet Type: MIXED LAYOUT (Fluency/Application/Reasoning)

## Structure
- **Section A: Fluency** (Q1-Q2) - Practice column subtraction with borrowing/exchanging
- **Section B: Application** (Q3-Q4) - Apply column subtraction to word problems
- **Section C: Reasoning** (Q5) - Explain or analyse exchange/borrowing method

## Year 3 Column Subtraction (With Exchange) Coverage

### Key Concepts
- Subtract 2-digit and 3-digit numbers using column method
- Exchange/borrow when top digit is smaller than bottom digit
- Understand why we "borrow" from the next column
- Cross out and add 10 to the next column

### Number Ranges
- **Easy (Foundation)**: 2-digit - 2-digit with one exchange
- **Average (Practice)**: 3-digit - 3-digit with multiple exchanges

### Example Problems (With Exchange)
- 52 - 38 = 14 (2 < 8, so borrow: 12 - 8 = 4)
- 342 - 167 = 175 (exchange in ones and tens)
- 503 - 268 = 235 (exchange with zeros)

## Section A: Fluency Questions (Q1-Q2)

### Question 1 - Column Subtraction with Exchange
Present vertical subtractions showing exchange.

### Question 2 - 3-Digit Exchange Practice
Multiple 3-digit subtractions requiring borrowing.

## Section B: Application Questions (Q3-Q4)

### Question 3 - Word Problem
Real-world context requiring column subtraction with exchange.

### Question 4 - Multi-Step Word Problem
More complex problem with larger numbers.

## Section C: Reasoning Question (Q5)

### Question 5 - Method Explanation
- "When 2 is smaller than 8, what do we do?"
- "Why do we cross out the tens and write one less?"
- Error spotting with borrowing mistakes
