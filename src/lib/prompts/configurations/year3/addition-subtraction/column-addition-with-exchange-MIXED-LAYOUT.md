## Year 3 Column Addition (With Exchange) Coverage

### Key Concepts
- Add 2-digit and 3-digit numbers using column method
- Exchange/carry when column sum exceeds 9
- Understand why we "carry" to the next column
- Write the small 1 above the next column

### Number Ranges
- **Easy (Foundation)**: 2-digit + 2-digit with one exchange
- **Average (Practice)**: 3-digit + 3-digit with multiple exchanges

### Example Problems (With Exchange)
- 27 + 48 = 75 (7+8=15, write 5, carry 1)
- 156 + 278 = 434 (exchange in ones and tens)
- 385 + 467 = 852 (exchange in ones and tens)
