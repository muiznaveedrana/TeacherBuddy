# Year 3 Column Addition (No Exchange) - Mixed Layout

## Worksheet Type: MIXED LAYOUT (Fluency/Application/Reasoning)

## Structure
- **Section A: Fluency** (Q1-Q2) - Practice column addition skills
- **Section B: Application** (Q3-Q4) - Apply column addition to word problems
- **Section C: Reasoning** (Q5) - Explain or analyse column addition methods

## Year 3 Column Addition (No Exchange) Coverage

### Key Concepts
- Add 2-digit and 3-digit numbers using column method
- Align digits correctly by place value (ones, tens, hundreds)
- No exchanging/carrying required (columns sum to 9 or less)
- Understand why column method works

### Number Ranges
- **Easy (Foundation)**: 2-digit + 2-digit, simple 3-digit + 2-digit
- **Average (Practice)**: 3-digit + 3-digit, mixed problems

### Example Problems (No Exchange)
- 23 + 45 = 68 (2+4=6 tens, 3+5=8 ones)
- 142 + 235 = 377 (no column exceeds 9)
- 421 + 356 = 777 (still no carrying)
